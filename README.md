# droidblox-kt
DroidBlox written in Kotlin

This repository is meant to replace the slow python implementation of DroidBlox, please forgive me for anything badly coded here as i'm still learning Kotlin :3
This is also meant to replace the root method implementated right now with a patched apk of Roblox

Once this application is stable, it will be merged into the [main repository](https://github.com/meowstrapper/DroidBlox)

# TODO
- [] Patch Roblox APK
- [] Optimize code
- [] Implement DI to compose functions and classes
- [] Make the navigation animation smooth
